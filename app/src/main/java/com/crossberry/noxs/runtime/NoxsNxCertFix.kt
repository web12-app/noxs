/*
 * Noxs — original implementation.
 * cert-fix.sh — the `nx cert-fix` guest command (installed into
 * /usr/local/lib/noxs-pkg by RootfsConfigurator; dispatched by NX_CLI).
 *
 * Why it exists: the shipped Debian rootfs is a minimal base WITHOUT
 * curl/wget/ca-certificates, and the app-side APT bootstrap (NoxsAptBootstrapper)
 * only runs from the Android side. When it never completed (failed network,
 * older app version, cancelled setup), the guest ends up with empty package
 * lists and no repair path — `apt-get install curl` says
 * "Unable to locate package curl" and plugins that need a downloader
 * (yt-dlp via the YouTube Downloader shim) are blocked. `nx cert-fix`
 * repairs everything from inside the shell, without reinstalling the app
 * or the environment.
 *
 * Repair steps (mirrors the app-side bootstrap policy):
 *  1. refresh the already-installed CA bundle (best effort)
 *  2. apt-get update — verified BEYOND the exit code (strict apt error
 *     mode, captured-output signature scan, populated-lists check);
 *     when HTTPS fails, switch to signed HTTP — Debian metadata stays
 *     GPG-authenticated over plain HTTP, so this is safe
 *  3. dpkg recovery for interrupted package configuration
 *  4. install ca-certificates + debian-archive-keyring + curl + wget
 *     (on failure: disk-space and dpkg-audit diagnostics in the TXT log)
 *  5. regenerate the CA bundle (update-ca-certificates --fresh)
 *  6. switch back to HTTPS, re-verify; keep signed HTTP only when TLS
 *     genuinely cannot work on this network
 *  7. verify curl/wget, the CA bundle, the package metadata and the lists
 *
 * The exit-code-only update check was a real bug: apt exits 0 in warn
 * mode even when index downloads failed, so a fresh rootfs without
 * ca-certificates "succeeded" the update, never triggered the signed-HTTP
 * fallback, kept the lists empty and failed every install with
 * "Unable to locate package" in under a second. A missing
 * noxs.sources (removed by hand or a partial setup) is now self-healed
 * from the canonical definition instead of aborting the repair.
 *
 * Reliability rules (same spirit as the app-side bootstrapper):
 *  - every network step is bounded (2 attempts, 3 s backoff) and two
 *    IDENTICAL failures in a row abort the retry loop
 *  - the single-flight package policy is honored: /run/noxs/pkg-tx plus
 *    running dpkg/apt processes are checked before any apt run, and the
 *    flag is armed for the duration of the repair
 *  - terminal output is a plain scrollback transcript plus ONE summary
 *    box drawn at the end — no cursor save/restore redraws, which garble
 *    when the terminal view scrolls during a multi-line redraw
 *  - a full TXT log under ~/.noxs/logs keeps the run auditable
 *  - the user's shell-facing apt wrappers (profile guard) are not bypassed:
 *    the script calls /usr/bin/apt-get directly with the same busy checks
 *
 * Encoding convention (same as the other nx templates): inside the raw
 * string a literal shell `$` is written as `§` and expanded by
 * .replace('§', '$').

# cert-fix.sh — nx cert-fix: repair the APT package layer of this Noxs
# Linux environment (CA certificates, package lists, curl/wget) without
# reinstalling anything. Part of the Noxs NX Package System.
#
# The update step never trusts the exit code alone: apt exits 0 in warn
# mode even when index downloads failed (a fresh rootfs without
# ca-certificates cannot complete an HTTPS fetch, and the failure is
# easy to miss). This repair therefore mirrors the app-side bootstrap
# policy: strict apt error mode, a scan of the captured output for
# failed downloads and TLS errors, and a populated-lists check — only a
# proven update lets the package install run, otherwise the signed-HTTP
# fallback takes over.
#
# Repair steps:
#  1. refresh the already-installed CA bundle (best effort)
#  2. apt-get update — verified beyond the exit code; when HTTPS fails,
#     switch to signed HTTP — Debian metadata stays GPG-authenticated
#     over plain HTTP, so this is safe
#  3. dpkg recovery for interrupted package configuration
#  4. install ca-certificates + debian-archive-keyring + curl + wget
#     (on failure: disk-space and dpkg-audit diagnostics in the TXT log)
#  5. regenerate the CA bundle (update-ca-certificates --fresh)
#  6. switch back to HTTPS, re-verify; keep signed HTTP only when TLS
#     genuinely cannot work on this network
#  7. verify curl/wget, the CA bundle, the package metadata and the lists
#
# Terminal output is a plain transcript — every line stays in the
# scrollback and is copy-paste friendly — plus one summary box drawn
# once at the end. No cursor save/restore redraws: when a terminal view
# scrolls during a multi-line redraw the frames overlap and garble.

Repairs the APT package layer of this Noxs environment:
  1. refreshes the installed CA certificate bundle
  2. apt-get update — verified beyond the exit code, with a signed
     HTTP fallback when TLS or the index downloads fail
  3. repairs interrupted dpkg configuration
  4. installs ca-certificates, debian-archive-keyring, curl and wget
  5. regenerates the CA bundle and re-verifies HTTPS
  6. verifies curl/wget, the CA bundle and the package metadata

Use it when apt cannot find packages ("Unable to locate package ..."),
when downloads fail with certificate errors, when the Noxs sources file
is missing, or after a setup that kept failing. A full TXT log is
written to ~/.noxs/logs/.
